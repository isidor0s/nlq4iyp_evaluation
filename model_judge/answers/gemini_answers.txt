Q2: Count ASes in Japan that originate prefixes.
As of early 2026, there are approximately **1,289** Autonomous Systems (ASes) registered in Japan, of which roughly **750 to 1,060** are actively originating prefixes into the global BGP routing table.

The discrepancy between "registered" and "originating" ASes occurs because some networks are registered for internal use (private peering), held in reserve, or are transitionary numbers that do not announce their own IP space to the public internet.

### Breakdown of AS Connectivity in Japan

The Japanese internet landscape is characterized by a high concentration of IP space within a few massive Tier-1 and domestic providers, alongside a large number of smaller regional ISPs and enterprise networks.

| Indicator | Approximate Count (2026) |
| --- | --- |
| **Total Registered ASNs** | 1,289 |
| **Active Originating ASNs** | ~752 (IPIP) to ~1,059 (IPinfo) |
| **Total IPv4 Addresses** | ~200 Million |
| **Top Originating AS** | AS17676 (SoftBank Corp.) |

### Top Originating ASes by IP Volume

The following table highlights the primary "originators" in Japan—the networks responsible for the largest blocks of announced IP addresses:

| ASN | Organization | Network Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AS17676** | SoftBank Corp. | ISP |
| **AS4713** | NTT DOCOMO BUSINESS (OCN) | ISP |
| **AS2516** | KDDI CORPORATION | ISP |
| **AS2907** | SINET (National Institute of Informatics) | Education/Research |
| **AS17506** | ARTERIA Networks | ISP |
| **AS2497** | Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ) | ISP |

---

### Key Observations

* **Origin vs. Transit:** While Japan has over 1,000 active ASNs, the "core" of the Japanese internet is highly centralized. Major players like **NTT (AS2914/AS4713)** and **IIJ (AS2497)** provide transit for a significant portion of the smaller originating ASes.
* **IPv6 Adoption:** Japan remains a global leader in IPv6 deployment. A significant percentage of the originating ASes in Japan (estimated at over 45%) now announce both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.
* **Infrastructure Density:** Most originating ASes are clustered around major Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in **Tokyo** and **Osaka**, such as JPNAP, JPIX, and BBIX.

Q3: Find the CAIDA AS rank for AS8075.
As of early 2026, the **CAIDA AS Rank** for **AS8075** (Microsoft Corporation) is **2933**.

CAIDA (Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis) ranks Autonomous Systems based on their **customer cone size**, which represents the number of direct and indirect customers an AS has. While Microsoft is one of the largest entities on the internet by traffic and IP space, its topological rank in CAIDA is often lower than Tier 1 ISPs because it operates primarily as a **Content Provider** rather than a traditional transit ISP.

### AS8075 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **AS Name** | MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK |
| **AS Rank** | 2933 |
| **Organization** | Microsoft Corporation |
| **Country** | United States |
| **AS Degree** | 304 (Global) |
| **Customer Cone** | 8 ASNs / 1,765 Prefixes |

### Why is the rank 2933?

It might seem counterintuitive for a giant like Microsoft to be ranked in the thousands. This is due to the specific way CAIDA calculates influence:

* **Transit vs. Peering:** Microsoft reaches most of the internet through **peering** (settlement-free exchange) rather than selling **transit** (where other networks pay them to reach the rest of the web).
* **Customer Cone:** CAIDA’s ranking heavily rewards "Provider" networks that have many downstream "Customer" networks. Since Microsoft is at the "edge" of the network (providing services to users, not selling internet access to other ISPs), its customer cone is relatively small compared to a global carrier like Lumen or Telia.

Would you like me to look up the CAIDA rank for a different organization, or perhaps compare AS8075 to other major content providers like Google (AS15169)?

Q4: On which AS does the United States depend on the most?
In the context of the internet's backbone, the United States depends most heavily on a few select **Autonomous Systems (AS)** that act as "Tier 1" providers. These networks form the core of the global internet, exchanging traffic without paying for transit.

While no single AS "controls" the U.S. internet, **AS3356 (Lumen, formerly Level 3)** is widely considered the most critical.

---

## 1. The "Big Three" Autonomous Systems

In 2026, the U.S. internet's stability and reach are primarily anchored by three massive providers. These are the networks that "tier 2" ISPs (like local cable companies) and "tier 3" providers must connect to in order to reach the rest of the world.

| ASN | Organization | Why It’s Critical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AS3356** | **Lumen (Level 3)** | Often cited as the #1 most connected AS in the world. It carries a massive percentage of U.S. government and corporate traffic. |
| **AS174** | **Cogent** | A high-volume transit provider that offers massive bandwidth and is essential for low-cost, high-speed data delivery across the U.S. |
| **AS701** | **Verizon (UUNET)** | Historically one of the most vital backbones; it remains a cornerstone for enterprise and government communications. |

## 2. Why AS3356 (Lumen) is Often Number One

If "dependence" is measured by how many other networks would lose connectivity if one AS failed, **AS3356** is the leader.

* **Breadth:** It has the most "adjacencies" (direct connections to other networks) of any U.S.-based AS.
* **Government Reliance:** It provides the underlying infrastructure for a vast majority of federal agencies and Department of Defense (DoD) communications.
* **Global Reach:** It owns a massive amount of undersea fiber-optic cable, connecting the U.S. to Europe and Asia directly.

## 3. Emerging Dependence: The Rise of Content Networks

While Tier 1 providers manage the "roads," the companies that own the "destinations" have become increasingly influential. In terms of daily traffic volume, the U.S. now depends heavily on:

* **AS13335 (Cloudflare):** Protects and serves roughly 20% of the web. A failure here would "break" a significant portion of the U.S. digital economy.
* **AS15169 (Google):** Carries more traffic than almost any other single entity due to YouTube and Search.
* **AS16509 (Amazon/AWS):** The backbone of U.S. cloud computing; most apps and startups depend on this AS to stay online.

Q5: Who manages DNS for the IP address 72.163.5.201?
DNS for the IP address **72.163.5.201** is managed by **Cisco Systems, Inc.**

This specific IP address serves as one of Cisco's primary authoritative name servers, known as **ns1.cisco.com**.

### Technical Details

* **Hostname:** `ns1.cisco.com`
* **Organization:** Cisco Systems, Inc.
* **Network Range:** 72.163.0.0/16 (assigned to Cisco by ARIN)
* **Location:** Richardson, Texas, USA
* **Autonomous System:** AS109 (Cisco Systems, Inc.)

### How DNS Management Works for this IP

In the DNS hierarchy, Cisco manages both the **Forward DNS** (pointing the name `ns1.cisco.com` to the IP) and the **Reverse DNS** (pointing the IP back to the name).

* **Forward DNS:** When you look up `cisco.com`, the global DNS system directs queries to this IP (and its siblings `ns2.cisco.com` and `ns3.cisco.com`) because they are the authoritative sources for all subdomains under cisco.com.
* **Reverse DNS (PTR):** A "Reverse Lookup" on **72.163.5.201** returns `ns1.cisco.com`. This record is maintained by Cisco within the address space delegated to them by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).

Would you like me to look up the administrative contact information or other name servers associated with this network?
