Q1: Find tags for AS109.
AS109 is an artist/AI-style label linked to the hentai artist “As109,” whose works and derivative AI models carry a specific, often explicit anime aesthetic. [diffus](https://www.diffus.me/tag/as109)

### Likely tag set around AS109

If you are looking for actual tag strings associated with AS109 images (e.g., for training or filtering), danbooru-style datasets list many recurring tags on posts by this artist. Common categories you will see include: [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)

- Character demographics: 1girl, 1boy, loli, elf, flat chest. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)
- Poses and composition: girl on top, cowgirl position, headpat, handjob, portrait (object). [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)
- Clothing and context: school uniform, serafuku, panties, skirt, shirt, school bag, shoulder bag. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)
- Body and expression: blonde hair, green eyes, blue eyes, blush, ahoge, mole, nipples, pubic hair. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)
- Sexual content: abuse, clothed male nude female, large insertion, hetero, censored, erection, guided penetration. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isek-ai/danbooru-tags-2016-2023)

In AI-model hubs, AS109 is also tagged as an **artist** or **style** (e.g., “as109 style”, “artist_style”, “LoRA”) for Stable Diffusion and related models. [seaart](https://www.seaart.ai/ko/tagInfo/model/as109)

If you tell me whether you need:  
- (a) the full raw tag lines for the AS109 entries from the danbooru dataset, or  
- (b) a cleaned tag list usable as a style descriptor for prompting,  

I can restructure these into a ready-to-use tag block.

Q2: Count ASes in Japan that originate prefixes.
The current number of ASes in Japan that originate prefixes (i.e., have at least one routed prefix visible in global BGP) is approximately 1,000–1,100. [bgp.he](https://bgp.he.net/country/JP)

### How this is determined

Public BGP statistics sites maintain per‑country lists of ASNs, showing how many prefixes each AS is originating.  For Japan, that list currently shows on the order of a bit over one thousand distinct ASNs with non‑zero originated IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes, which is where the 1,000–1,100 figure comes from. [bgp.he](https://bgp.he.net/country/JP)

### Notes and caveats

- This count only includes ASNs that actively originate at least one prefix in the global routing table; ASNs registered to Japanese entities but not currently announcing routes are excluded. [bgp.he](https://bgp.he.net/country/JP)
- The exact number fluctuates over time as new networks come online, others withdraw routes, or change country registration. [bgp.he](https://bgp.he.net/country/JP)

Q3: Find the CAIDA AS rank for AS8075.
CAIDA’s AS Rank for **AS8075** is **2933**. [asrank.caida](https://asrank.caida.org/asns/8075)

Q4: On which AS does the United States depend on the most?
In interdomain routing terms (Autonomous Systems on the global Internet), the United States does not have a single foreign AS it “depends on the most”; its connectivity is intentionally spread across many large transit providers and IXPs to avoid that kind of dependency. [pulse.internetsociety](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/blog/2025/08/the-digital-roads-to-government-services-uncovering-consolidation-and-exposure/)

### Why there is no single key AS

- Large U.S. networks (Tier‑1s like Lumen, AT&T, Verizon, etc.) peer with each other and multiple foreign carriers, so no one foreign AS is a single choke point for U.S. traffic. [bidenwhitehouse.archives](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Roadmap-to-Enhancing-Internet-Routing-Security.pdf)
- Recent measurements of government and other critical services show that countries such as the USA distribute traffic across multiple operators and exchange points exactly to improve resilience and reduce dependency on any one network. [pulse.internetsociety](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/blog/2025/08/the-digital-roads-to-government-services-uncovering-consolidation-and-exposure/)
- Global routing studies of “few throats to choke” highlight central ASes in various regions, but they do not identify a unique foreign autonomous system on which U.S. connectivity overall critically depends; instead they find a set of influential backbones and content networks worldwide. [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07038.pdf)

### What we can say instead

- The U.S. Internet is heavily interconnected with a group of large global transit providers and content networks (major Tier‑1 ISPs and CDNs), but dependency is shared among many ASes rather than dominated by one. [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07038.pdf)
- Policy work on “internet routing security” in the U.S. focuses on securing BGP, RPKI, and route origin validation across many domestic and foreign operators, again assuming a multi‑operator ecosystem rather than a single critical AS. [bidenwhitehouse.archives](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Roadmap-to-Enhancing-Internet-Routing-Security.pdf)

If you meant a different kind of “AS” (for example, a specific foreign carrier, a country’s ASN, or a particular service’s upstream), clarify the context (e.g., “US government websites”, “US mobile users”, “a specific provider”) and I can narrow it down.

Q5: Who manages DNS for the IP address 72.163.5.201?
The IP address 72.163.5.201 belongs to Cisco Systems, Inc., and its reverse DNS hostname is **ns1.cisco.com**. [who](https://who.is/whois-ip/ip-address/72.163.5.201)

In practice, that means Cisco Systems, Inc. is the organization that manages DNS (including the reverse DNS/PTR record) for 72.163.5.201, within their allocated 72.163.0.0/16 netblock and AS109. [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/72.163.5.201)
